This is a project that was completed by myself and two peers. The purpose of this project is to make an e-commerce website that sells groceries and provides the user with some functionality. HTML, CSS, PHP, ASP, Javascript, MySQL and various API's were used. The main takeaway from this project was that I learned how to work with a team to develop a website and how to make a good user experience.
